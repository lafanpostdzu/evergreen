However, some players may encounter issues when trying to run the game on RPCS3, a PlayStation 3 emulator for Windows and Linux. RPCS3 is an open-source project that aims to provide a high-quality emulation of PS3 games on PC. However, not all games are fully compatible or playable on RPCS3 yet.
 
One of the common problems reported by players is that the game hangs on load with an error message like "F PPU [0x1000000] Thread (main\_thread) [0x002da6b8] class std::runtime\_error thrown: Trap! (0x2da6b8)" or "'sys\_fs\_open' failed with 0x8001003a : CELL\_ENOTMOUNTED, â/dev\_bdvd/PS3\_GAME/USRDIR/TR8/USRDIR/BIGFILE.000â [1]"[^1^] [^2^]. This means that the game cannot access the required files or libraries to run properly.
 
Fortunately, there is a possible solution for this issue. You will need to download a patch file called "tomb raider trilogy bles 01195 patch fix 3 55 3 41.rar" from a reliable source. This patch file contains modified files that can bypass the errors and allow the game to load on RPCS3. You will also need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the patch file.
 
Here are the steps to apply the patch:
 
1. Download the patch file from a reliable source and save it to your PC.
2. Extract the patch file using WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder called "BLES01195" with several subfolders inside.
3. Copy the folder "BLES01195" and paste it into your RPCS3 game directory. This is usually located at "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\RPCS3\dev\_hdd0\game". If you already have a folder with the same name, overwrite it with the new one.
4. Launch RPCS3 and select The Tomb Raider Trilogy from your game list. You may need to refresh your game list if you don't see it.
5. Configure your emulator settings according to your preferences and system specifications. You can check the RPCS3 wiki for recommended settings for each game[^1^].
6. Start the game and enjoy!

Note: This patch may not work for everyone or for every version of RPCS3. It may also cause some glitches or performance issues in some parts of the game. Use it at your own risk and make sure you backup your original game files before applying the patch.
